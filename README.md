# PersonalProject_RhythmGame_1.0.0
 
 A very simple endless rhythm game without music, play by pressing up, down, left, right button at the right time to gain points. Download Rhythm Game.exe to play the game.
 
 I made this simple game to learn how to use Godot game engine, and I made sprites using Piskel. 

 This is a product followed by guidance of "Clickteam Fusion Developer" Youtube channel's "Tutorial RHYTHM GAME in Godot Engine" video. See more at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwvcmbY8wiY&ab_channel=ClickteamFusionDeveloper
