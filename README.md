# PersonalProject_RhythmGame_1.0.0
 
 A simple rhythm game without music, play by pressing up, down, left, right button at the right time to gain points. 
 
 I made this simple game by Gidot for game engine and Piskel for sprites.

 This is a product followed by guidance of "Clickteam Fusion Developer" Youtube channel's "Tutorial RHYTHM GAME in Godot Engine" video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwvcmbY8wiY&ab_channel=ClickteamFusionDeveloper
